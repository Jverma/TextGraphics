{"name":"Textgraphics","tagline":"Graphical techniques for text mining. ","body":"TextGraphics is a python module for graphical methods in text mining. It can create two types of graphs from a corpus of text files. \r\n\r\n1. sentenceGraph - nodes are sentences in the corpus and edges are defined between two nodes based on the cosine similarity of the normalized word frequency vectors of the sentences represented by the nodes. \r\n2. keywordGraph - nodes are keywords in the corpus and edges are defined between two nodes based on the co-occurances of the keywords represented by the nodes. \r\n\r\nWe choose a threshold for cosine similarity or co-occurance count. \r\n\r\nAnalysis package contains codes to study basic properties of the graphs and methods to plot the graphs. \r\nAlso there is an implementation of Girvan-Newman algorithm for extracting the communities in the graph. \r\n\r\nApplications imclude auto summarization based on LexRank and topic modeling. \r\n\r\n<b>Dependencies:</b>\r\n\r\n1. numpy\r\n2. networkx\r\n3. matplotlib\r\n4. nltk (for stemming only)\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Usage:</b>\r\n\r\n<code> \r\nfrom TextGraphics.src.graph import TextGraph\r\n\r\n<code>\r\ng = TextGraph(corpus)\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nsenGraph = g.sentenceGraph()\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nkeyGraph = g.keywordGraph()\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfrom TextGraphics.Applications.summary import LexRank\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nlR = LexRank(corpus)\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nlR.summary()\r\n\r\nSee testCode.py for usage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
